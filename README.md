# SnakeGame

Snake spin off made in Love2d

After indicating which direction they'll shoot in for a few seconds, apples will release a stream of bullets in said direction. Contact with the bullets means death. As the snake, your job is to devour the apples before they can put an end to you.

This game supports both touch screen and keyboard controls. The mouse can be used to select a difficulty. The arrow keys can be used to control the Snake

## How to Run:

To run the game, clone this repo, download the [Love2d game framework](https://love2d.org/) and drag the repo folder onto the Love2d executable file.
